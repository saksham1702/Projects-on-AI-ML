# Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals using a machine learning approach. The analysis leverages data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and ensures data consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes relationships between features and heart disease occurrence.
- **Model Training**: Includes multiple machine learning algorithms to find the best-performing model.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC for model evaluation.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository and install required libraries:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   cd Heart_Disease_Prediction
   pip install -r requirements.txt
