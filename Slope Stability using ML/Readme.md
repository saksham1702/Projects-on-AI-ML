# Dump Slope Stability in Indian Opencast Coal Mines

This study rigorously examines the pressing issue of **dump slope stability** in Indian opencast coal mines, a problem that has led to significant safety incidents and operational hindrances. The study employs machine learning algorithms such as:

- **Random Forest (RF)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Logistic Regression (LR)**
- **Decision Tree (DT)**
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB)**

The goal is to achieve predictive accuracy for slope stability under various environmental and operational conditions. Promising accuracies were attained, notably with:

- **RF**: 0.98
- **SVM**: 0.98
- **DT**: 0.97

To address the **class imbalance** issue, the **Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)** was implemented, resulting in improved model performance. 

Additionally, this study introduced a novel **feature importance** technique to identify critical factors affecting dump slope stability, offering new insights into the mechanisms leading to slope failures.

## Implications
These findings have significant implications for enhancing safety measures and operational efficiency in opencast mines, not only in India but potentially globally.

## Key Points
- Focus on **slope stability** in Indian opencast coal mines
- Machine learning algorithms used: RF, KNN, SVM, LR, DT, and GNB
- **Class imbalance** addressed using **SMOTE**
- Introduction of a novel **feature importance technique**
- **Potential global impact** on mining safety and operational efficiency
