Paper title : UNDERLYING MANUFACTURING OF PHARMACEUTICALS IN MICROGRAVITY AND SPACE
Abstract : Human space exploration has advanced from
survival in space to complex scientific research,
epitomized by the International Space Station
(ISS). As missions extend to the Moon and Mars,
challenges like microbial contamination and
altered immune responses become critical.
Space's hostile environment—extreme
temperatures, vacuum, cosmic radiation, and
microgravity—affects human physiology and
drug stability.

This literature review explores
the impact of these conditions on
pharmaceuticals, addressing astronaut safety,
drug discovery acceleration, benefits for Earth,
and drug development needs for space missions.
Innovations like 3D printing and microfluidics
are crucial for maintaining medication efficacy
and supporting long-duration missions, ensuring
the success and sustainability of human space
exploration.

Paper title: Unraveling the financial dimension of Space endeavors
Abstract : Astro-economics, an emerging interdisciplinary field, examines the economic principles
and implications of human activities in outer space. This literature review explores the
evolution, current state, and future prospects of astro economics, highlighting key themes
such as the commercialization of space, space tourism, resource utilization, and the
economic impact of space policies. The review synthesizes findings from academic
articles, industry reports, and policy papers, providing a comprehensive overview of how
economic theories are applied to space-related activities. It identifies major stakeholders,
including private companies, governmental agencies, and international organizations, and
discusses their roles in shaping the economic landscape of space. Additionally, the review
addresses the challenges of space debris, the viability of space mining, and the potential
for sustainable economic growth through space exploration. By integrating economic
models with space science, the field of astro economics offers valuable insights into the
financial viability and strategic planning required for future space endeavors. This review
concludes by outlining the critical areas for further research and the implications for
policymakers and industry leaders aiming to navigate the complexities of the space
economy.

Paper title : Beyond the Visible: A Comprehensive Literature Review of Dark Matter Theories and Experiments
Abstract: The matter we can see only makes up about 15% of the total matter in the universe. The remaining 85% is invisible dark
matter. In this systematic literature review on dark matter cosmology, we have provided an overview of several potential
dark matter candidates, such as WIMPs, Axions, Primordial Black Holes, ALPs (Axion-like particles), etc. This review
mentions the effects of dark matter particles on their surroundings like the emission of radiation, interaction with visible
matter, microlensing effect, etc which formed a basis for several experiments that have been conducted over the years to
detect these particles. The theoretical concepts related to Dark Matter like the paradox of youth problem, the Interacting
Boson-Fermion
Model (IBFM-2), evaporation of PBHs due to hawking radiation and several other concepts have been discussed. This review
also aims to give a detailed explanation of several independent experiments that have been conducted across the globe to
detect the presence of these dark matter particles. Some of the most significant experiments that have been conducted and
the results obtained from them have been mentioned. Additionally, we describe the design and working principles of
various detectors used in these experiments along with their sensitivity.

Paper title: EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CMBR DATA IN CONSTRAINING
COSMIC STRUCTURE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW
Abstract : The study of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) provides critical insights into the early
Universe, revealing small anisotropies that carry within themselves information about its structure and evolution. We present the
challenges of understanding the structure of the Universe by examining discrepancies in the ΛCDM model, the development of
galaxies, and the era of reionization. The paper focuses on the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect and its implications for galaxy
clusters. Further, It discusses the tensions within the ΛCDM model, particularly in determining the Hubble constant (H0), and
the role of voids and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in resolving these discrepancies.
High-redshift galaxy surveys bring forth new information about galaxy formation and evolution while also assessing the
limitations of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in studying reionization. Our findings suggest a slower-than-expected growth
of large-scale structures in the dark energy era, indicating potential gaps in our current cosmological models. Furthermore, The
PLANCK mission's contributions to CMB studies are discussed, emphasizing on the legacy data that continue to shape our
understanding of the cosmos. This paper aims to unravel the complexities underlying the CMBR and its implications for
cosmological research, and how these small complexities and differences could lead to discoveries in the near future.
